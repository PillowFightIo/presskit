Two Scoops is a fresh, new visual novel + dating sim about love and ice cream! It's the story of a big girl in a small town who finds romance at her local ice cream shop. 

In this game, you take on the role of a young woman who has just started a new job at a local, family-owned ice cream shop. She's taken on a big responsibility, too: two of the employees are going away soon, leaving her to fill their shoes! With only a week remaining before their departure, the situation seems tricky for our protagonist, but she is determined to show that she's the right one for the job, all while growing closer to her co-workers along the way.

	<history>
Pillow Fight Games was founded after two devs had too much fun developing We Know the Devil. We think diversity means inclusive teams and original stories that reach a diverse audience. That’s why our games are developed with fair pay and accessibility as top priorities.
