	<description>
	Rose of Winter is a romantic visual novel set in a fantasy world of dragons, knights, and monsters. Rosemary is an aspiring knight with big dreams, but for now, she’s doing odd jobs where she can find them. This adventure finds her at the foot of Mount Needle, and with four hot princes to escort through the dangerous mountain pass. Players will navigate dangerous weather, fight off wildlife, and definitely there is smooching.
