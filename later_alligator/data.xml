Later Alligator tells the story of Pat the alligator, a (mostly) harmless and (probably) innocent reptile at the center of a conspiracy that could bring down the biggest, scariest family in Alligator New York City: his own! Explore the city, meet the Family, and try to save Pat before the clock runs out. 

Alligator New York City comes to life with the classic hand drawn animation style of SmallBu Animation, featuring densely animated areas to explore, 30 goofy minigames, and over 100 alligator residents to investigate. With multiple endings and a fully-animated cartoon finale, Later Alligator is a funny urban adventure you can play again and again.

    <history>
Pillow Fight Games was founded after two devs had too much fun developing We Know the Devil. We think diversity means inclusive teams and original stories that reach a diverse audience. That’s why our games are developed with fair pay and accessibility as top priorities.
